AI is used only where humans normally think, not where regex is enough.

2. AI #1 — Discover NEW job websites 🌐
Problem

You don’t want to manually add:

Job boards

Small company career pages

Startup sites

Solution

Use AI as a website intent classifier.

Step A — Candidate website discovery (NON-AI)

Sources:

Google search results

Startup directories

GitHub org websites

Company homepages

Example collected data:

{
  "url": "https://example.com/careers",
  "html_title": "Careers at Example",
  "meta_description": "Join our engineering team",
  "text_sample": "We are hiring software engineers..."
}

Step B — AI Website Classification (PROMPT)
🎯 Goal

Decide:

Is this a job site?

Is it tech-related?

Is it worth scraping?

✅ Prompt: Website Job Source Classifier
You are a strict website classifier.

Given a webpage snapshot, classify whether this page is a job listing source.

Return JSON only.

Rules:
- "is_job_site" = true if the page contains job postings or career listings
- "tech_related" = true if jobs are software, engineering, or IT related
- "confidence" from 0 to 1
- "reason" = short explanation

Webpage data:
Title: {{title}}
Meta description: {{meta}}
Text sample:
{{text}}

✅ Expected response
{
  "is_job_site": true,
  "tech_related": true,
  "confidence": 0.92,
  "reason": "Career page advertising multiple software engineering roles"
}

Backend logic
if result.is_job_site && result.tech_related && result.confidence > 0.8 {
    registerSource(url)
}


💡 This is where AI shines — discovering unknown job sources.

3. Scraper Engine (Go) 🕷️

Once a source is approved:

Scraper interface
type JobScraper interface {
    FetchJobs(since time.Time) ([]RawJob, error)
}


Each source:

Fetches jobs from last 7–10 days

Deduplicates by URL

Normalizes HTML

4. AI #2 — Job relevance & matching 🧠

Now the important part: Is this job good for YOU?

Step A — Rule-based prefilter (FAST)
if !contains("golang", description) {
    discard
}


Only pass relevant jobs to AI.

Step B — AI Job Matcher (PROMPT)
🎯 Goal

Score job relevance for:

Golang backend

Software engineering

Your tech stack

✅ Prompt: Job Relevance Scoring
You are a technical recruiter specializing in backend engineering.

Evaluate how well this job matches the following candidate profile.

Candidate profile:
- Backend Engineer
- Golang
- REST, gRPC
- PostgreSQL, Redis
- Linux, Docker
- Microservices

Job posting:
Title: {{job_title}}
Description:
{{job_description}}

Return JSON only with:
- match_score (0 to 100)
- strengths (array)
- weaknesses (array)
- short_summary (1 sentence)

✅ Expected response
{
  "match_score": 87,
  "strengths": ["Golang", "Backend APIs", "PostgreSQL"],
  "weaknesses": ["Kubernetes not required"],
  "short_summary": "Strong backend Go role with database-heavy services"
}

Score combination logic
finalScore = (ruleScore * 0.4) + (aiScore * 0.6)


Only show:

finalScore >= 70

5. PostgreSQL lifecycle ⏱️
Retention rules

Jobs older than 30 days → DELETE

Scraper only fetches last 7–10 days

Cron job (example)
DELETE FROM jobs
WHERE created_at < now() - interval '30 days';

6. Frontend behavior 🖥️
Filters

Match score (slider)

AI summary

Job link

You are a website intent classifier.

Analyze the following webpage snapshot and decide if it is a company careers page with job listings.

Return JSON only with:
- is_career_page (true/false)
- has_open_positions (true/false)
- tech_roles_present (true/false)
- confidence (0 to 1)
- short_reason (1 sentence)

Webpage data:
Title: {{title}}
Meta description: {{meta}}
